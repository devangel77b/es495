Affordable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Sensors, Modular Payloads and Algorithmic Tools for Ecological Study

Ecological and behavioral studies and conservation efforts are often complicated by the need to gather data in remote or inaccessible areas. In military and intelligence missions, unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have been instrumental in providing remote access and persistent presence. We will discuss an on-going design effort to develop affordable UAS designs, as well as sensors and modular payloads, by leveraging developments in hobby radio/control and autonomous flight, 3D printing, and rapid prototyping. We consider both fixed-wing and quadrotor designs. We will also discuss modular payloads, including visible and thermal imaging and automated image processing. The rugged nature of biological field studies and unique challenges help drive innovations that may transfer to naval use. We will present concept designs and initial prototyping for notional missions to image and count organisms and/or nests along a shore; survey an area, field, or stretch of river, repeatedly to identify areas of interest; and potentially recovering a sample from an inaccessible location on an island top or inside a sinkhole. We will also discuss the logistics of training undergraduate engineers as UAS operators (USNA's "School of Drones") and plans to deploy in support of a science mission. We anticipate our UAS and the designs we develop will be made available for science work, and hope to connect with potential future missions using UAS to support biological studies.
