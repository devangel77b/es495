"micro-McKibben" muscles for application in bio-inspired soft robotics

Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM, e.g. McKibben actuators) are soft, pressure driven actuators consisting of an elastic membrane surrounded by relatively stiff helical fiber windings oriented to constrain the actuator to shorten when pressurized. They are similar in construction to many hydraulic skeleton forms found in nature. PAMs have important applications in soft robotic systems, due to their flexibility. Small PAMs (<8mm, "micro-McKibben") are of increasing interest for compact applications that require light weight, but are challenging because force productions scales with the smaller actuator area. We wil discuss on-going development and modeling of small PAMs, constructed of silicone with PET braiding, intended for use in exoskeleton applications for rehabilitation of the hand and fingers. Because of our application, we require closed-loop, adaptive position control to ensure the device does not hyperextend the patient, and we may also desire finely graded control; thus we need to develop input-output models for small PAMs able to be used for control. We will discuss models that take air pressure as input, and output strain, with model parameters that correct for free force and blocked force. We validated the models against measurements made in prototype small PAMs.  With the validated models, we will implement linear and adaptive control systems to drive micro-McKibben small PAMs installed in hand and finger exoskeleton rehabilitation devices.
